# Detecting-influencers-on-tweets-about-Ukrainian-War

 This repository is composed of 3 parts:
 * `Influencers:` 
 1. We scraped tweets of 12 influencers on twitter using **tweepy** 
 2. We implemented sentiment analysis on tweets and check their correlation with their engagement. Are Positive or negative tweets leading to more engagement?
 3. We looked over the  best hashtags used and integrated **KNN** machine learning model to check how the influencers are classified.
Kindly note that each influencer has a notebook ipynb file
* `Influencers.csv:` A csv file of the tweets gathered plus all the new columns added like postive and negative score of each influencer's tweet
* `Twiiter virality:` After we gathered all the analysis, we explained the work done through a power-point presentation and we sum-up by picking the **most influential** one over the 12 persons that we chose.
