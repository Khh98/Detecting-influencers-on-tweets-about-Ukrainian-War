# Detecting-influencers-on-tweets-about-Ukrainian-War

 This repository is composed of 3 parts:
 * `Influencers:` We scraped tweets of 12 influencers on twitter using **tweepy** and we implemented sentiment analysis on tweets and check their correlation with their engagement. Are Positive or negative tweets leading to more engagement
In addition, we did hashtag analysis and integrated KNN machine learning model to check how the influencers are classified.
Kindly note that each influencer has a notebook ipynb file
* `Influencers.csv:` A csv file of the tweets gathered plus all the new columns added like postive and negative score of each influencer
* `Twiiter virality:` After we gathered all the analysis, we explained the word done through a power-point presentation and we sum-up by picking the most influnetial one over the 12 person that we picked.
